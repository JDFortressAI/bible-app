## Why We Need to Read the Bible

<div class="about-text">Like the Sons of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what to do (1 Chronicles 12:32), weâ€™re called to anchor ourselves in Godâ€™s Word to navigate todayâ€™s chaos. Instead of doom-scrolling through endless noise, redeem those precious five minutes in the morning or evening to hear Godâ€™s voice. Reading the Bible daily sharpens your discernment, renews your mind, and aligns your heart with His truth, equipping you to stand firm in these pivotal days.</div>

## Why the NKJV?

<div class="about-text">The New King James Version (NKJV), rooted in the <em>Textus Receptus</em> manuscript, carries a timeless weight and clarity that resonates deeply. Its fidelity to the original texts ensures youâ€™re engaging with a translation that honors the inspired Word. The NKJVâ€™s poetic cadence and precision make it a powerful choice for hearing God speak clearly, without distraction, straight to your soul.</div>

## Why Mâ€™Cheyne?

<div class="about-text">When was the last time you committed to reading the entire Bible but didnâ€™t finish? Or read it cover to cover? The Mâ€™Cheyne (or McCheyne) Bible Reading plan is a game-changer: it guides you through the Old Testament once, and the New Testament and Psalms twice, every year. Its four daily passages weave together beautifully, revealing connections across Scripture that youâ€™ll only discover by sticking with it. This plan isnâ€™t just a scheduleâ€”itâ€™s a journey to experience Godâ€™s Word in its fullness.</div>

## We Welcome Your Feedback

<div class="about-text">Our heart is to serve the Body of Christ, helping believers return to Godâ€™s Word in these end of the end times. This app is designed to be simple, beautiful, and distraction-free, so you can focus on what matters: hearing from God. Weâ€™re here to listenâ€”your feedback helps us make this tool better for you and the Church. <a href="mailto:contact@jdfortress.com">Share your thoughts freely</a>, and letâ€™s grow together in devotion to His Word.</div>
